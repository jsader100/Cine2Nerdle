This a bot created to play the movie trivia game Cine2Nerdle Battle: https://www.cinenerdle2.app/battle

This only works for the "Challenge a Friend" mode. The program prompts for the game link. Once it has the game link the bot will play the game!

Things to improve:
- Script will crash if one of the top 4 listed cast members has been in less than 5 movies. Need to rethink how to select connected movies.
- Create export csvs that will help me record data to help debug.
- Create more movie selection logic so that I can implement difficulties.
- Try to make the program be able to play multiple games via rematch or by accepting a new link.
